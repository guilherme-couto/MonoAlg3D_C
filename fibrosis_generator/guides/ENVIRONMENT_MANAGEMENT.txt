CONDA ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT GUIDE
Project: Perlin Noise Fibrosis Generator

1. OVERVIEW
This project relies on specific system-level dependencies (Octave, C++ compilers) managed through Conda. This guide details how to maintain, update, and share the environment configuration to ensure reproducibility.

2. INITIAL SETUP
The environment 'perlin-fib-env' was initialized with the following configuration:
Channel: conda-forge (required for up-to-date Octave and compilers)
Key Packages:
- octave
- gxx_linux-64 (G++ compiler for Linux)
- make

Command used for creation:
$ conda create -n perlin-fib-env
$ conda activate perlin-fib-env
$ conda install -c conda-forge octave gxx_linux-64 make

3. MAINTAINING THE ENVIRONMENT FILE (environment.yml)
To ensure other users (or yourself on a different machine) can replicate this exact setup, you must generate an 'environment.yml' file. This file lists all installed packages and versions.

Action:
After installing any new package, run the following command to update the definition file:

$ conda env export > environment.yml

Note: It is recommended to run this command every time you install a new dependency to keep the documentation current.

4. INSTALLING NEW PACKAGES
When adding new tools, prioritize the 'conda-forge' channel to avoid conflicts with system libraries.

Command:
$ conda install -c conda-forge <package_name>

After installation, repeat step 3 to update 'environment.yml'.

5. RECREATING THE ENVIRONMENT
If setting up this project on a new machine or after a clean wipe, use the YAML file to recreate the environment identically.

Command:
$ conda env create -f environment.yml

6. MANUAL CHANGE LOG (OPTIONAL)
Use this section to track major additions to the environment and the reasoning behind them.
